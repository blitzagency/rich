Rich
=======

Welcome to the Rich GitHub Repo.

## About
Rich is our take on the famo.us marionette framework.  It allows you to write code that looks and feels like marionette but with all of the power of famo.us.

We are currently in very active development and things WILL change on a daily/weekly basis.  This includes core api, adding/removing of things, and a huge amount of instability.  Please keep this in mind if you decide to try things out.

## Approach
The intent behind Rich is to keep the marionette *view intact while backing that view by the famous engine.  We have kept nearly all marionette logic and are currently built ontop of the latest marionette code.

## Getting Started
Download this repo, [Famo.us][], and [Marionette.js 2.1.0+][], and off you go.  Demo's can be viewed by running `$ make serve` from inside of the demos directory.
